"""Tests for _build_authbridge_runtime_yaml helper.

Emits the per-plugin schema authbridge expects — every plugin-
specific setting lives inside its own plugin entry under
pipeline.inbound.plugins[] or pipeline.outbound.plugins[].
Plugin-level defaults (audience_file, bypass_paths, identity
file paths) are applied by the authbridge binary itself; this
helper deliberately omits them.
