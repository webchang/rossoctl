        as defense-in-depth in front of the operator's webhook gate.
        Both have been lifted now that the operator + extensions
        support the full matrix (rossoctl-operator#381,

        combinations.

        TODO(future-incompatibility): re-enable cross-field rejections

        rossoctl-operator's pod_mutator auto-enables SPIRE when

        boundary. The UI form still locks the mTLS dropdown when
        SPIRE is off as a UX hint, but a non-UI client (CLI, direct
        API call) submitting that combination is valid and the
        operator turns SPIRE on for them.
