"""Async HTTP client for the simulation harness control plane (issue #2162).

Thin wrappers over the harness REST API at `/api/v1/simulation`. Each call
creates its own short-lived `httpx.AsyncClient`, matching the in-cluster HTTP
call pattern used elsewhere in the backend (e.g. skill_autosync, sidecar_manager).
