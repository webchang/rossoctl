"""Transparent inbound interception E2E (rossoctl/cortex#330).

The load-bearing test here is ``test_direct_pod_dial_is_validated``: the reason
the feature exists is that JWT validation must not be sidestepped by another pod
dialing the agent's real port. Everything else either proves the shape under
test is actually the transparent one, or guards against the feature breaking
what it runs alongside.
