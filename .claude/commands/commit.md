## CI Checks

The following CI checks will run automatically on PRs:

1. **CI Workflow** (`ci.yaml`) - Runs on all PRs:
   - Python lint with flake8
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - Pytest for rossoctl/ui

2. **PR Kind Deployment** (`pr-kind-deployment.yaml`) - Runs on PRs affecting:
   - `rossoctl/**`
   - `deployments/ui/**`
   - `.github/**`
   - `charts/**`

   This workflow:
   - Creates Kind cluster
   - Builds and deploys Rossoctl platform
   - Runs deployment health checks
   - Runs E2E tests
   - Uploads test results

### Running CI checks locally:

```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks (via uv)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Run flake8 syntax check (via uv)
uv run flake8 rossoctl/tests/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics

# Run UI tests
cd rossoctl/ui && uv run pytest

# Run E2E tests (requires deployed Rossoctl platform)
cd rossoctl
uv pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_deployment_health.py -v
```

## Notes

- Pre-commit hooks are required for DCO sign-off verification
- All commits in a PR should follow this convention
- Multi-line commit bodies are optional but encouraged for complex changes
- CI must pass before PRs can be merged
