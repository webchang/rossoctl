3. **Email**: Send reports to **rossoctl-maintainers@googlegroups.com**
4. **Include**: A clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce,
   affected versions, and potential impact

### Security Contacts

- **rossoctl-maintainers@googlegroups.com**

## Security Measures

This project implements several security controls:

- **CI/CD Security**: All workflows use explicit least-privilege permissions with
  hash-pinned GitHub Actions
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning via Trivy and Dependabot
  with weekly update cadence
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks with Gitleaks for secret scanning
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL and Bandit for static analysis
- **Container Security**: Hadolint for Dockerfile best practices, base images pinned
  to sha256 digests
- **Supply Chain**: OpenSSF Scorecard monitoring, SLSA-compliant build process
- **Runtime Security**: Istio Ambient mTLS, SPIFFE workload identity, Landlock/seccomp
  sandboxing for agent execution
