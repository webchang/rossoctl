# Data Governance

## Executive Summary

The Data Governance service provides a comprehensive solution for data visibility, risk, policies and enforcement across the platform. It delivers comprehensive, data-aware governance, risk assessment and enforcement capabilities natively within the platform, ensuring secure data lifecycles and robust risk mitigation across complex AI agent ecosystems.


## Core Capabilities & Strategic Pillars:

- Traceability at Scale (Collection & Enrichment)
Systematically collect, classify, and enrich data flow traces across the entire agentic platform to establish complete, scalable observability.

- Advanced Threat Detection (Analysis & Monitoring)
Deploy sophisticated data flow analysis technology capable of monitoring multiple agent trajectories and sessions. This continuous analysis operates over configurable time windows to proactively detect and mitigate critical risks, specifically targeting potential data breaches and data corruption.

- Autonomous Policy Enforcement (Data Barriers)
Implement robust Data Barriers designed to enforce strict, policy-driven dataflow constraints. These barriers will operate autonomously to govern the entire data lifecycle, specifically controlling how information is accessed, transformed, and retained within the system.

## Current scope
- Lineage plugin - collects events from cortex.
- Data Governance pod - computes interactions and entities from raw spans.
- Data Classification - classification of payloads for known personal/confidential data types.
- Observability - Execution flow graph
- Loosely coupled UI dashboard (linked from within the main rosso UI, under Observability)
