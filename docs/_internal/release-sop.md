# Release Management SOP

Standard Operating Procedure for releasing Rossoctl, aligned with CNCF project
conventions (Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD).

> **Related:** [docs/releasing.md](releasing.md) contains the procedural step-by-step
> instructions. This document covers policy and governance.

## 1. Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `main` | Active development; all features merge here | Permanent |
| `release-X.Y` | Stabilization and patches for a minor series | Permanent once created |

### Rules

- **`main` is always releasable.** CI must pass; broken builds are P0.
- **Release branches are cut at RC time**, not before. Alpha releases tag directly from `main`.
- **No direct commits to release branches.** All fixes land on `main` first and are cherry-picked back (exceptions: release-only metadata changes like version bumps).
- **One active release branch per minor version.** Example: `release-0.6` covers `v0.6.0-rc.1` through all `v0.6.Z` patches.

### When to Create a Release Branch

```
main ─────●────●────●────●────●────●─── (development continues)
                              │
                              └─── release-0.6 ─── rc.1 ─── rc.2 ─── v0.6.0 ─── v0.6.1
```

Create `release-X.Y` when cutting the **first RC**:

```bash
git checkout -b release-X.Y main
git push origin release-X.Y
```

---

## 2. Pre-release Lifecycle

### 2.1 Alpha Releases

**Purpose:** Milestone snapshots for early testing. May break between releases.

**Naming:** `vX.Y.0-alpha.N` (e.g., `v0.7.0-alpha.1`, `v0.7.0-alpha.2`)

**Criteria to tag:**
- CI passes on `main`
- No known data-loss or security issues in the tagged commit
- All image tags in `values.yaml` pinned (no `latest`)

**Cadence:** As needed during active development (typically every 1-2 weeks during a cycle).

**Process:**

```bash
# Determine next alpha number
git tag --list 'vX.Y.0-alpha.*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1

# Tag (follow multi-repo dependency order - see Section 6)
git tag -s vX.Y.0-alpha.N -m "vX.Y.0-alpha.N"
git push origin vX.Y.0-alpha.N
```

### 2.2 Release Candidates

**Purpose:** Feature-complete builds for validation. Code freeze in effect.

**Naming:** `vX.Y.0-rc.N` (e.g., `v0.7.0-rc.1`, `v0.7.0-rc.2`)

**Code freeze rules:**
- Only bug fixes, test fixes, and documentation changes are allowed.
- No new features, refactors, or dependency upgrades (unless fixing a security issue).
- All changes go through the normal PR process targeting the release branch.

**Entry criteria:**
- [ ] All planned features for the milestone are merged to `main`
- [ ] No open P0/P1 bugs against the milestone
- [ ] Feature freeze declared on Slack/mailing list
- [ ] Release branch created from `main`
- [ ] All image tags pinned to RC version

**Progression:**
- If bugs are found during RC testing, fix on `main`, cherry-pick to release branch, bump to `rc.N+1`.
- Maximum 3 RCs recommended. If more are needed, re-evaluate scope.

---

## 3. Stable (GA) Releases

**Naming:** `vX.Y.0` (first GA of a minor series), `vX.Y.Z` (patches)

**Promotion criteria:**
- [ ] At least 1 RC validated with no release-blocking issues
- [ ] Minimum 1-week soak since last RC (recommended)
- [ ] At least one maintainer sign-off (not the person who tagged the RC)
- [ ] E2E tests pass on Kind and OpenShift
- [ ] Upgrade path from previous GA tested
- [ ] Release notes written and reviewed

**Process:**

```bash
# On the release branch
git checkout release-X.Y

# Verify the RC tag is the HEAD (or contains only release metadata commits)
git log --oneline release-X.Y...vX.Y.0-rc.N  # should be empty or trivial

# Tag GA
git tag -s vX.Y.0 -m "vX.Y.0"
git push origin vX.Y.0
```

**Post-release:**
- Mark GitHub Release as "Latest"
- Announce on Slack and mailing list
- Update installation docs with new version

---

## 4. Maintenance and Patching

### 4.1 Cherry-Pick Workflow

All fixes land on `main` first. To backport to a release branch:

```bash
# 1. Identify the commit(s) to cherry-pick
git log --oneline main | grep "<fix description>"

# 2. Cherry-pick onto release branch
git checkout release-X.Y
git cherry-pick -x <commit-sha>  # -x adds "cherry picked from" reference

# 3. Resolve conflicts if any, then push
git push origin release-X.Y

# 4. Tag the patch
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `-x` flag is mandatory — it creates traceability between main and the backport.

### 4.2 Security Patches vs. Bug Fixes

| Aspect | Security Patch | Bug Fix |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Timeline | ASAP (24-72h target) | Next patch window |
| Disclosure | Private fix, coordinated disclosure | Public PR on main |
| RC required? | No (direct to patch tag) | Recommended for non-trivial fixes |
| Backport scope | All supported release branches | Latest release branch only (unless critical) |
| Communication | Security advisory + CVE | Release notes |

**Security patch process:**
1. Fix developed in a private fork or restricted branch
2. Patch applied to all supported release branches simultaneously
3. Tags pushed for all affected versions
4. GitHub Security Advisory published
5. Announce on mailing list with CVE reference

### 4.3 Support Window

| Policy | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| Active support | Current GA (N) — bug fixes and security patches |
| Security-only | Previous GA (N-1) — security patches only |
| End of life | N-2 and older — no further releases |

---

## 5. Multi-Repo Dependency Order

Rossoctl spans multiple repositories. Tags must be created in dependency order:

```
1. rossoctl/operator      →  tag, wait for CI
2. rossoctl/cortex    →  tag, wait for CI
3. rossoctl/rossoctl               →  update Chart.yaml + values.yaml, tag
```

**Between each step:** Verify container images and Helm charts are published before proceeding to the next repository.

---

## 6. Automation and Tooling

### Release image pinning

Installers use local charts from the repo checkout — they do NOT pull from OCI.
Therefore image tags must be pinned in the committed `values.yaml` files before
tagging.

**Pin all images in one command:**

```bash
bash scripts/pin-release-tags.sh v0.6.0-rc.6
```

This updates tags across both `charts/rossoctl/values.yaml` and
`charts/rossoctl-deps/values.yaml`. See [docs/releasing.md — Pinning Image
Tags](releasing.md#pinning-image-tags-before-release) for details.

**Validate before tagging:**

```bash
bash scripts/check-release-pins.sh
```

This validates both charts for `tag: latest` entries and detects tag drift
between `rossoctl-deps` and the main platform chart.

### Currently Automated (via existing `build.yaml` workflows)

| Step | Trigger | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| Container image build + push | Tag push (`v*`) | Images on `ghcr.io/rossoctl/` |
| Helm chart package + push (with tag pinning) | Tag push (`v*`) | OCI charts on `ghcr.io/rossoctl/` |
| GitHub Release creation | Tag push (`v*`) | Release with auto-generated changelog |
| Pre-release flag | GoReleaser `prerelease: auto` | `-alpha`/`-rc` tags marked as pre-release |
| Pin validation (`ci-release-pins.yaml`) | PR touching `charts/` | Summary on all PRs; hard gate on `release/*` branches |

### Recommended Additions

| Automation | Trigger | Purpose | Priority |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Release branch protection** | Branch creation matching `release-*` | Enforce PR reviews, required CI, no force push | P0 |
| **Changelog generation** | Tag push | Generate structured changelog from conventional commits (e.g., `git-cliff`) | P1 |
| **Cross-repo orchestration** | Manual workflow dispatch | Trigger dependency-ordered release across repos | P2 |
| **Cosign image signing** | After image push | Sign images with Sigstore keyless signing | P2 |
| **SBOM generation** | Tag push | Produce CycloneDX SBOM per image | P3 |
