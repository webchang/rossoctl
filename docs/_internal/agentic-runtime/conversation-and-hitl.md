# Conversation Lifecycle and Human-in-the-Loop

> Back to [main doc](openshell-integration.md)

## Conversation Models

OpenShell and Rossoctl support three distinct conversation models. Each agent
type uses one or more of these models.

### Model 1: Terminal Session (OpenShell native)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User (CLI)
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant SB as Sandbox Pod
    participant Agent as Claude/OpenCode

    User->>GW: openshell sandbox create -- claude
    GW->>SB: Create pod + supervisor
    SB->>Agent: exec agent process
    User->>GW: SSH tunnel
    GW->>SB: Bridge to port 2222
    loop Terminal I/O
        User->>Agent: Type prompt
        Agent->>User: Stream response
    end
    User->>GW: Disconnect (Ctrl-D)
    Note over SB: --keep flag preserves pod
    User->>GW: openshell sandbox connect <id>
    GW->>SB: Re-attach SSH
    User->>Agent: Continue conversation
```

- **Agents:** openshell_claude, openshell_opencode
- **Context storage:** Agent process memory (lost on pod restart)
- **Session persistence:** dtach + PVC for workspace files
- **Multi-turn:** Natural — continuous terminal I/O

### Model 2: A2A Request-Response (Rossoctl native)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Rossoctl UI
    participant BE as Backend
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Agent as A2A Agent

    UI->>BE: Send message
    BE->>DB: Load conversation history
    BE->>Agent: A2A message/send (with contextId)
    Agent->>BE: A2A response
    BE->>DB: Store turn in session
    BE->>UI: Stream response
    Note over DB: Context persists in DB
    UI->>BE: Send follow-up
    BE->>DB: Load full history
    BE->>Agent: A2A message/send (contextId + history)
    Agent->>BE: Response with awareness of history
```

- **Agents:** weather_agent, adk_agent, claude_sdk_agent
- **Context storage:** Rossoctl backend PostgreSQL
- **Session persistence:** Database-backed (survives pod restart)
- **Multi-turn:** Backend reconstructs context from DB each turn

### Model 3: Exec-Based Interaction (Hybrid)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BE as Rossoctl Backend
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant SB as Sandbox Pod
    participant Agent as Agent Process

    BE->>GW: ExecSandbox(command, stdin)
    GW->>SB: kubectl exec
    SB->>Agent: Pipe stdin to process
    Agent->>SB: stdout response
    SB->>GW: Capture output
    GW->>BE: Return result
    BE->>BE: Store in session DB
```

- **Agents:** weather_supervised (via kubectl exec), builtin sandboxes (via ExecSandbox gRPC)
- **Context storage:** Rossoctl backend PostgreSQL + workspace PVC
- **Session persistence:** Backend manages context, PVC preserves files
- **Multi-turn:** Backend sends accumulated context with each exec

## Current Agent Context Capabilities

| Agent | Context Source | Multi-Turn | Persist Across Restart | Conversation Model |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| weather_agent | None | Stateless | No | Model 2 (A2A) |
| adk_agent | ADK in-memory | contextId returned but not preserved | No | Model 2 (A2A) |
| claude_sdk_agent | None | Stateless | No | Model 2 (A2A) |
| weather_supervised | None | Stateless | No | Model 3 (exec) |
| openshell_claude | Agent process memory | Terminal session | With dtach + --keep | Model 1 (terminal) |
| openshell_opencode | Agent process memory | Terminal session | With dtach + --keep | Model 1 (terminal) |

## How to Enable Multi-Turn for Each Agent

### A2A Agents (weather, ADK, Claude SDK)

**Option A: Backend-managed context (recommended)**
The Rossoctl backend stores conversation history in PostgreSQL. Each turn,
the backend loads the full history and includes it in the A2A request as
additional context. The agent itself remains stateless.

```python
# Backend pseudo-code
history = session_db.get_history(session_id)
prompt = f"Previous conversation:\n{history}\n\nNew message: {user_message}"
response = await a2a_send(agent_url, prompt, context_id=session_id)
session_db.append_turn(session_id, user_message, response)
```

**Option B: Agent-side session store**
Add a PVC to the agent deployment and store conversation state on disk.
The agent loads state from disk on each request using a session ID.

**Option C: ADK contextId fix**
Wait for upstream Google ADK to support client-sent contextId in `to_a2a()`.
This would enable native multi-turn without backend involvement.

### Builtin Sandboxes (Claude, OpenCode)

**Option A: Terminal session (native)**
The CLI+SSH model provides natural multi-turn. The agent process maintains
context in memory. With dtach, the session survives disconnects.

**Option B: ExecSandbox + backend context**
The Rossoctl backend calls ExecSandbox gRPC to send prompts. The backend
maintains conversation history in PostgreSQL and reconstructs context
for each exec call.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Design

### What HITL means in the sandbox context

HITL is when an agent needs human approval before performing a sensitive
action. Examples:
- Agent wants to push code to a git branch → needs approval
- Agent wants to install a package → needs policy review
- Agent wants to access a restricted API → needs credential approval
- Agent wants to delete files → needs confirmation

### Current HITL support

| Layer | HITL Support | How |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **OpenShell OPA policy** | Implicit deny | Policy blocks disallowed actions; agent gets error |
| **OpenShell proxy** | Implicit deny | HTTP CONNECT denied for blocked hosts |
| **Rossoctl UI** | `HitlApprovalCard` component | UI component exists for approval workflows |
| **Rossoctl backend** | Session events | Can intercept and hold agent actions |

### HITL Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent
    participant Proxy as Supervisor Proxy
    participant OPA as OPA Engine
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant BE as Rossoctl Backend
    participant UI as Rossoctl UI
    participant Human as Human

    Agent->>Proxy: HTTP request (e.g., git push)
    Proxy->>OPA: Evaluate policy
    OPA->>Proxy: Decision: REVIEW_REQUIRED
    Proxy->>GW: HITL event (action, context)
    GW->>BE: Webhook notification
    BE->>UI: Show HitlApprovalCard
    UI->>Human: "Agent wants to push to main. Approve?"
    Human->>UI: Approve / Reject
    UI->>BE: Decision
    BE->>GW: Forward decision
    GW->>Proxy: Allow / Deny
    Proxy->>Agent: Response (200 OK or 403 Forbidden)
```

### HITL Levels

| Level | Description | Implementation | Phase |
|-------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **L0: Implicit deny** | Policy blocks action, agent gets error | OPA Rego `default allow = false` | Current (PoC) |
| **L1: Log and allow** | Action allowed, event logged for audit | Supervisor proxy + OCSF events | Phase 2 |
| **L2: Async review** | Action allowed, human reviews after the fact | Backend event stream + UI | Phase 2 |
| **L3: Sync approval** | Action blocked until human approves | Proxy hold + gateway webhook + UI card | Phase 3 |

### HITL Use Cases Per Agent

| Use Case | weather | adk | claude_sdk | supervised | openshell_claude | openshell_opencode |
|----------|---------|-----|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Approve LLM call | N/A | L1 | L1 | L1 | L1 | L1 |
| Approve external API call | N/A | L0 | L0 | L0/L3 | L3 | L3 |
| Approve file write | N/A | N/A | N/A | L0 | L3 | L3 |
| Approve git push | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | L3 | L3 |
| Approve package install | N/A | N/A | N/A | L0 | L3 | L3 |
| Budget limit reached | N/A | L2 | L2 | N/A | L2 | L2 |

### What's needed for each HITL level

| Level | Components | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| L0 | OPA policy + supervisor proxy | **Implemented** in weather_supervised |
| L1 | L0 + OCSF event export + OTel | Requires supervisor OTLP exporter |
| L2 | L1 + backend event ingestion + UI display | Requires backend webhook + EventsPanel |
| L3 | L2 + proxy request hold + gateway webhook + HitlApprovalCard | Requires upstream OpenShell support for policy `REVIEW_REQUIRED` decision |
