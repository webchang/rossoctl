# Claude Code Daily Commands

Quick reference for the skills and commands you'll use regularly when working on
Rossoctl. For setup, prerequisites, and workflow details, see the
[Claude Code Development Guide](./claude-code.md).

## Developer Commands

### Morning Orientation

Start your day by checking what needs your attention:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/github:my-status` | Your open PRs, pending reviews, assigned issues, worktree status |
| `/git:status` | All worktrees with PR status and TODO files overview |

**Example morning workflow:**

```
> /github:my-status
> /git:status
```

### During Development

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/git:worktree <name>` | Create isolated worktree for a feature/fix | Starting new work |
| `/git:rebase` | Rebase onto upstream/main (gfur alias) | Before push, when PR has conflicts |
| `/ci:status <PR#>` | Check CI status for a specific PR | After pushing changes |
| `/ci:monitoring` | Watch running CI, get notified on completion | After push, waiting for results |
| `/k8s:health` | Platform health check across all components | Before testing, after deploy |
| `/k8s:pods` | Debug pod crashes, failures, networking | Pod not starting or crashing |
| `/k8s:logs` | Search component logs for errors | Investigating runtime issues |

### Committing and Shipping

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/git:commit` | Properly formatted commit with emoji + sign-off | Every commit |
| `/tdd <issue/PR/desc>` | Full TDD loop (implement, test, push, iterate) | Feature work or bug fixes |
| `/rca <failure URL>` | Systematic failure investigation | CI failure or runtime issue |

## Maintainer Commands

### Weekly Repository Health

Run these weekly (or before standup) to stay on top of repository health:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/github:last-week` | Full weekly report: merged PRs, new issues, CI trends, recommendations |
| `/github:issues` | Issue triage: stale, unattended, blocking, close candidates |
| `/github:prs` | PR health: needs review, stale, failing CI, merge conflicts |

**Example weekly workflow:**

```
> /github:last-week
```

This calls `github:issues` and `github:prs` internally, so you get everything
in one command. Use the individual skills when you need focused triage.

### CI and Quality

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/ci:status <PR#>` | Detailed CI check analysis for a PR | Reviewing contributor PRs |
| `/skills:retrospective` | End-of-session skill improvement review | After debugging sessions |

### Issue and PR Management

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/repo:issue` | Create properly formatted issue (bug, feature, epic) |
| `/repo:pr` | Create properly formatted PR with summary |
